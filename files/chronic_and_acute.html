  What is actually going on when you’re in pain? What differs in acute vs
  chronic pain and what happens when acute turns into chronic pain?</div>
<p><div class="a w3-padding-large">
    Hi, I’m Dmitro, a manual osteopathy student at the Canadian Academy of
    Osteopathy, and would love to share what I know through the point of
    view of functional anatomy and physiology, to help you understand your
    body a little better. The mechanisms we have in place all have their
    purpose and it’s important to understand the process to better
    understand how to deal with pain.
  </em><</div>
</p>
<p><div class="a w3-padding-large">
  When we injure our bodies, from over-exertion or a traumatic accident, for
  example, we go through a phase of <em>acute pain</em> that is very local to
  the site of injury, typically sharp pain making the area hot and/or swollen
  to the touch as blood is shuttled to the area. In addition, typical
  injuries include muscular contractures (prolonged spasms) that constrict
  the venous drainage out of the area. The swelling stage is a way for your
  body to compartmentalize and contain the troubled region and add stability
  to the area so that further damage can be minimized and the pain allows us
  to consciously be aware of it, so we can avoid it. This stage is extremely
  important because it is the beginning of the healing process. Swelling is
  your friend in this situation and not the culprit. With blood being sent to
  the area, swelling is commonly associated with, as a state that needs to be
  reduced by either putting ice or taking anti-inflammatory medication.
  Understanding that nutrient rich arterial blood going to the area to begin
  recovery, would tip off that delaying the process may not be the best
  strategy at the infancy stage of the injury.
</p></div>
<p><div class="a w3-padding-large">
  By allowing the process to occur naturally, once the joint or area of
  injury is contained through inflammation and has healed enough, the
  swelling subsides As the body begins to heal the injured tissue, it while
  simultaneously lay down fibrous tissues to help stability while the healing
  is occurring. These tissues are tough and similar to ligaments, and begin
  to form around the area to aid in stability as the injured area cannot
  perform its proper function, and thus needs to change the structure around
  it to accommodate. One of the principles of osteopathic thinking, is that
  structure and function are inter-related. This means that the intended
  structure; its shape, orientation, and size, can help you determine its
  function. In other words, the fibrous tissues are there as a response to
  the function (or lack there of), being immobile and needing the structural
  support If the joint or structure is injured and cannot move, it is
  unstable and the ligamentous layers that are there to protect you from
  further damage.
</p></div>
<p><div class="a w3-padding-large">
  Now, what does pain have to do with any of this? Why am I talking about
  blood, they’re too different things, right? Yes, they are different but
  their relationship could not be any closer. During swelling, let’s say from
  an ankle injury, the swelling adds pressure on the nerve endings at the
  site of injury, and sends sensory <em>efferent nerves </em>or nerves to the
  spinal cord and processes it as sharp pain as many of the nerve endings are
  under pressure from the swelling. Once the area swelling or edema has
  subsided and that layer of fibrous tissue is accumulated in the area, the
  nerves are now under less stress with only the deeper tissues tender and we
  are able to use the larger muscles with more mobility. As we begin to
  increase the movement, the fibrous structures are broken down and flushed
  away. The important thing to note is, once the acute stage has hit the
  chronic stage, it is very important to correct any misalignments that are
  preventing proper motion of the joint, or the chronic injury will begin to
  affect nearby structures in a chain reaction.
</p></div>
<p><div class="a w3-padding-large">
  In addition, it is possible that the chronic injuries that are longstanding
  trigger acute dysfunctions or “flare-ups”. This occurs when abnormal
  stimulus occurs for a long period of time, affecting the deep muscles of
  the spine that hold the joint motion. These are intrinsic and are muscles
  that we cannot specifically control. When these muscles are in an already
  heightened state, something seemingly small can be just enough to have a
  traumatic effect. This restarts the loop of an acute injury, inflammation
  and further fibrotic build-up.
</p></div>
<p><div class="a w3-padding-large">
  If we can intersect the abnormal loop of injury, with manual therapy, we
  can stop the cycle and encourage the proper nerve communication and
  unobstructed circulation in and out of the area.
